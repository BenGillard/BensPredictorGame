**Welcome to the Euro 2024 Predictor Championship!** The aim of the game is simple, predict the scores for all of the group stage games at this year's tournament. Each correct *score* earns 3 points. Each correct *result* earns 1 point.

<!--**Follow this [link](https://github.com/BenGillard/BensPredictorGame/blob/main/Predictor.xlsm?raw=true) to download the entry spreadsheet.** Please send the completed spreadsheet file with the subject line "Predictor 2024" to benspredictorgame@gmail.com. Then forward to all your friends so they can get involved too. Deadline is 10pm on Tuesday 11th June ahead of the first fixture on 14th June so get your entry in quick!

**Each entry costs £5 so please follow the instructions on how to pay that you'll receive after submitting your spreadsheet.**-->

<!--Previous years have had up to 50 players so it is always a healthy kitty to play for. Although the bragging rights remain the most valuable prize.-->

WE ARE LIVE! All entries have been fed into the predictor machine and there is nothing left to do except watch how your predictions turn out.

We have **`r length(Results)-2` players** involved so we have a healthy kitty to pay out for the **top 5 players. £`r round(x = (length(Results)-2)*5*0.45, digits = 2)` goes to the top dog. £`r round(x = (length(Results)-2)*5*0.25, digits = 2)` for the top loser. £`r round(x = (length(Results)-2)*5*0.15, digits = 2)` for the best of the rest. And £`r round(x = (length(Results)-2)*5*0.05, digits = 2)` for 4th, 5th, and 6th places.**

On the [Leaderboard] you'll see an extra player called *RandomControlEntry* in <span style="color: red;">red</span>. These predictions were generated randomly using the macro included in the spreadsheet. So if you have fewer points than *RandomControlEntry*, any thought you put into your entry was an utter waste of time. 

Go to [Results Tracker] for a more in depth look at which games scored you points.

Forgot what you put for an upcoming game? Want to see what your bitter rival predicted too? Go to the [Entry Reminder] section and use the drop down to find full predictions for a specific player.

To see players who have been immortalised by victory in previous tournaments, see the [Predictor Hall of Fame].

<!--> These are test results to make sure everything is working properly! Once all entries have been submitted I will update the webpage.-->

# Leaderboard

How things stand after **`r sum(!is.na(ResultsSoFar[,3]))` games out of `r nrow(Results$RandomControlEntry)`**. At the end of the game (Match Day 36 on 26th June 2024), winners will be contacted by email for their details so they can receive their hard fought winnings.

Correct games shows how many games you have scored points from (total correct scores and results).

# NEW FOR 2024, THE PREDICTOR CUP

#Your first 30 predictions may have been awful but there is still a chance to be a winner! Euro 2024 sees the arrival of the inaugural Predictor Cup.

#Qualification for the cup is based on the three fixtures on the 22nd June (Georgia vs Czechia (Match 24), Turkiye vs Portugal (Match 23), and Belgium vs Romania (Match 22)). The top scoring players from these three fixtures will enter the cup (see Cup Qualifying table. Teams highlighted in green will enter the cup). Note that you cannot qualify for the cup with 0 points. If there is an uneven number of players, those that have scored well in the qualifying fixtures will recieve a bye in the first round. Your predictions for fixtures over the final days of the group stages will be your entry into the cup. You will be pitted against a random opponent to better their prediction. If you have matching points after the designated game, a second game on that day will be used. If it is still a draw, the closest number of goals predicted will decide the tie. If you come out on top you progress to the next round and so on until there is only one player left.

## England Goals (tie breaker)

Tracks the tie break question of how many goals England will score. The TrueGoals are updated after every [England game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM).

```{r englandGoals, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mar=c(7,4,4,4))
TrueGoals<- as.numeric(readxl::read_excel("PredictorTrueResults.xlsm")[35,14])
AllGoals<- list(TrueGoals = TrueGoals) #seed list so player predictions can be added
for(file in entries){
predictionsRoot<- readxl::read_excel(file) #change to file
player<- gsub(" ", "", as.character(predictionsRoot[32,12]),  fixed = TRUE)
EngGoals<- as.numeric(predictionsRoot[35,14])
#result information
AllGoals<- append(AllGoals, list(EngGoals)) #append player's predictions to list seeded by correct results
names(AllGoals)[length(AllGoals)]<- player #rename list with player name
}
barplot(unlist(AllGoals), main = "Tie Breaker: England Goals scored", col = c("red", "white"), las = 2, cex.names = 0.7)

# Hypothetical Euros

Who do we, as a collective of Mystic Megs, predict will be the winners and losers in the group stage? This plot shows how many times each team has been predicted to win a match in the group stages.

```{r IfwePredicted, fig.show='hold'}
WinnerCount<- sapply(names(Results[2:length(Results)]), function(x) summary(as.factor(Results[[x]][["Result"]])), USE.NAMES = TRUE)

barplot(sort(sapply(unique(Results$CorrectResults$Home), function (x) sum(grepl(x = names(unlist(WinnerCount)), pattern = x)))), horiz = TRUE, las = 1, cex.names = 0.5, col = viridis::rocket(24), main = "Total (all players combined) predicted Wins for each team", xlab = "Number of wins predicted")

#, xlim=range(pretty(c(0, max(sapply(unique(Results$CorrectResults$Home), function (x) sum(grepl(x = names(unlist(WinnerCount)), pattern = x)))+1))))

#top predicted result
#barplot(table(unlist(lapply(names(WinnerCount), function(x) names(WinnerCount[[x]])[which(WinnerCount[[x]] == max(WinnerCount[[x]]))]))), horiz = TRUE, las = 1, cex.names = 0.5, col = viridis::rocket(10), main = "Overall most predicted results", xlab = "Number of wins predicted", xlim=range(pretty(c(0, 10))))

#bottom predicted result
#barplot(table(unlist(lapply(names(WinnerCount), function(x) names(WinnerCount[[x]])[which(WinnerCount[[x]] == min(WinnerCount[[x]]))]))), horiz = TRUE, las = 1, cex.names = 0.5, col = viridis::magma(10), main = "Overall least predicted results", xlab = "Number of wins predicted", xlim=range(pretty(c(0, 3), n = 3)))
```

More specifically, how many times does each player think the home nations will win in the group stage  (more teams available on request)? And how many boring draws do people think we'll suffer through?

# Results Tracker

This Results Tracker has a bit more depth than the [Leaderboard]. It shows what points everyone has scored for each game.

Hover over each tile for more information (might not work on phones). Green = Correct Score (3 points), Yellow = Correct Result (1 point), Grey = Wrong! (nil pois).

```{r ExtraBits}
#EXTRA BITS TO INCLUDE NEXT TIME AROUND
  #Automatically calculate England goals because I keep forgetting to update that box.
  #Hypothetical Tourney - Everyone's predicted group winners. Bit of complex coding required. Predicted points too?
      #kable table for each group
  #Is there an API or something that results can be extracted from so everything updates automatically?

#API in R tutorial: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-api-tutorial/
  #https://statisticsglobe.com/api-in-r#looping-multiple-api-calls

#KNOWN ISSUES
  # sending back the spreadsheet in any format other than the original .xlsm will cause numbers to be imported and therefore interpreted differently. Like causing the correct score calculation to fail. added a line of code to check in the import chunk but maybe should add this to the spreadsheet instructions
  # macro enabled file type causes security concerns on some computers. To enable the macro and editing you have to tell Windows to trust the file. Right click on the file, go to "properties", and click the unblock tick box at the bottom.

#THINGS TO CHANGE EACH YEAR
  # In spreadsheet: Euro/Worldcup and date to appropriate and logo picture
  # In spreadsheet: Fixture list (get from internet spreadsheet if available)
  # In spreadsheet: macro cells to fill

  # In rmd script: title and blurb at start, change to current year etc
  # In rmd script: change whatsapp group name on picture (can just reuse the same code each time)
  # In rmd script: change import dimensions depending on the number of fixtures

  # On github: Update link for entry spreadsheet

  # Republish ResultsApp.R once all entries have been submitted

  # on gmail: update drafts for automatic replies. Then save draft as a template, overwriting previous one.
